# Unified Momentum Model
This repository contains a reference implementation of the Unified Momentum Model presented in [**paper title**] published in [**journal name**]. The Unified Momentum Model is a novel approach for modeling a yaw-misaligned actuator disk induction and outlet velocities, including negative and high thrust regimes. 

It builds on the existing actuator disk model described in [Heck, K. S., Johlas, H. M., & Howland, M. F. (2023). ***Modelling the induction, thrust and power of a yaw-misaligned actuator disk***. Journal of Fluid Mechanics](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2023.129).
